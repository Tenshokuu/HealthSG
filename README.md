---

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### 1. Requirements

* Node.js (LTS version is best)

### 2. File Setup

1. Save your module file as `HealthySG.js`.
2. Create a file called `app.js` in the same folder.
3. Add this sample code to try out the system:

```js
const healthySG = require("./HealthySG");

// Register a patient
console.log(healthySG.registerPatient("T1234567Z", "Jane Doe", "91111222", "1985-09-20", "789 Clementi Ave 3"));

// Book an appointment
console.log(healthySG.bookAppointment("T1234567Z", "2025-06-10", "10:00", "Dr. Lim"));

// View appointments
console.log(healthySG.getAPTbyNRIC("T1234567Z"));

// Make a partial payment
console.log(healthySG.payDaBill("S7654321B", 70));

// Apply for a grant
console.log(healthySG.payDaBill("S7654321B", 0, true));

// View outstanding bills
console.log(healthySG.billsbyNRIC("S7654321B"));

// Cancel an appointment
console.log(healthySG.cancelAppointment("APTNO2"));
```

### 3. Run the App

```bash
node app.js
```
